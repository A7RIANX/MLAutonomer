# About ML Autonomer
ML Autonomer is a Web-based Image Classification ML model trainer using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) methodology for Sipeed KendryteK210 an AI-IoT module which can use Deep Learning to achieve an AI-support related tasks (AI-vision, Voice recognition)

## Why ML Autonomer
Kendryte K210 not supported a generic Machine Learning model because Sipeed's Kendryte K210 have it own ML model format, to operate the AI module related task, The available options was:
1) Sipeed's Official website - If you prefers to do the simple task, this might Consumes a considerable amount of time.
2) Made it own - User needs to coding, optimizing and converting to compatible with K210.
3) ML Autonomer - No coding for making Machine Learning model, Ideal for simple task, beginners friendly.

This service will provide user the non-coding ML Models for Kendryte K210 module as a result.

## Instructions:
1. Drag/Put the Set of the images to the provided area.
2. Label/Naming the Set of the images.
3. Repeat step (1) and (2) in order for another Image sets.
4. Click the button below for doing magic, user sits within a few minutes.
5. Done and dusted - The image model ready to serve.

## What's inside ML Autonomer
We use the AIWintermuteAI's aXelerate as an original ML based for Kendryte K210 ML model, and we optimized/adapted into the Web application service.

## Project Issues (Updated 30/5/24)
- Imported libraries may not be working as intended (e.g. Dropzone may accepted any files instead of accepting image files only)

### Note
- The project was not update for 3 years ago, recently I have noticed  some library is updated/deprecated and may cause the issues, leading to make the Webapp won't functioning properly as we are intended.

- I have terminate our own MS Azure service due to the monthly subscription cost to operate the service, so this repository is about the Webapp page which user only "partially experienced".
